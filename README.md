# Howard Technical test for Neami National

## Task

It is important for the candidate to treat Neami National as customers/end users.

If user enters a correct username and password, it should take them to a welcome screen where it would display “welcome “ + name entered in the box.

Final solution should contain everything a customer might need or expect.

## Result

To start: `npm start` in project directory. User should be presented with username and password boxes. If "Howard" and "password" are submitted, the screen will show "Welcome {username}", in this case "Welcome Howard". Any other submission will result in an error message.
